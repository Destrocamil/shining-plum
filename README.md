In order to get the weather widget working, you'll need an API key for openweathermap.com. Place it in `~/.config/awesome/scripts/weather.py`  
To get the gmail widget working, get your Oauth credentials.json and place it in `~/.config/awesome/scripts/credentials.json`  
This was intended to work on my machine, so don't be surprised when it doesn't work on yours. You're welcome to steal bits and bobs of code and my widgets for your own use.
